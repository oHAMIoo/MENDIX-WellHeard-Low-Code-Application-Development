Problem Statement & Project Objectives
With the global impact of Coronavirus, most people are experiencing unprecedented pressure and anxiety while they can only stay at home and work remotely.
Meanwhile, many licensed therapists are unable to find business because it is impossible to have appointments physically. It is a waste of business opportunity
if there’s no convenient system for both therapists and potential patients to communicate online and fill up each other’s needs.

According to our research from the National Health Expenditure (NHE) Fact Sheet, National Health Expenditure grew 4.6% to $3.6 trillion in 2018,
or $11,172 per person, and accounted for 17.7% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
Therefore we believe the potential market will keep increasing as the quarantine continues.

Thus, we want to build an efficient online psychological counseling platform that allows people to take online psychological tests and surveysto figure out potential problems and seek help if needed.
Individual licensed therapists are also allowed to leverage the platform instead of randomly looking for patients by themselves,
because the platform could bring patients directly to them so they can help patients with their specialties.
In order to make sure the therapist's reputation, patients could also look at the therapist's resume now and anonymous reviews from other patients that links to the therapist.
The idea is to help people who may face psychological problems due to the quarantine and many who may not find therapists nearby.
The platform will reduce the elements of physical distancing and provide service anytime, anywhere.

The system will function with following capabilities:
- Provide a convenient evaluation process to test potential patients’ need
- Find a good match from the registered therapists database
- Functions for online schedule, reschedule, comment, read review, make payment
- Online registration process for Therapist and set up his or her preference for appointments and patients.
- Communication and privacy functions to support Therapist’s work
- The project objectives will focus on:
- Efficiency: create a simple C2C system for both therapists and patients
- Customer Experience: the usability of platform in terms of providing service
- Process: Improve the business process to make appointments more efficient
- Quality: Make sure we qualify therapists before allow them to meet with customers
- Compliance: Regulations of finance relationship between customers and therapists


Expected Business benefits
As consumer-based care has evolved during the pandemic, telehealth services as a business model is becoming the new preference for healthcare check-ins
both from the customer’s view and from the health service professional’s perspective. 
A low cost operating model brings larger margins of profitability for therapists to operate out of a work from home environment. 
Additionally, specifically to this platform, therapists could operate individually and would not need to maintain employees,such as receptionists and other assistants.

Also during the ongoing global pandemic, continued contactless services is a benefit for the customer, therapist, and the much larger global landscape.
It it not only serving a purpose for direct telehealth operations, but it is also aiding the world’s fight against Covid-19 by limiting interactions.

Broken down into two elements of business valuation, tangible and intangible, we can see the product can bring huge benefits that no other health and wellness applications can offer.
Tangible elements include: 
- monetary and stockholder value increase
- market share
- revenue
Intangible elements include: 
- brand recognition 
- customer loyalty 
- customer retention


Process/Methodology
The development process our team is using is very similar to many front-end customer to customer models.
We wanted to create a process that would facilitate the searching, matching and set up of appointments between those seeking therapy and the service providers themselves.
To accomplish this we needed the first step to simply query between several factors which include:
- if the service will be in person or via mobile
- if insurance is accepted or not
- the relative proximity of the therapist to the patient
- the ratings/specialties of the therapist.
 

Information Collection
Our group has been collecting information online and offline to collect the most information as possible.
We started by asking a series of questions from a client and user perspective. 
It all came to this very same question: What are we delivering that the user wants? 

A focused and detailed collection of information is the first thing to help to solve problems.
This is the process of discovering, analyzing, defining, and documenting the requirements that are related to a specific business objective.
In our case, the online psychology therapist platform with functional requirements such as:
- A chatting platform with identity privacy
- Easy payment plan that connects between patients, insurance companies and therapists.
- An AI system which can quickly test and give results to first time users about their symptoms and help pairs with suitable therapists.
- An identity check system to confirm the qualification of all therapists registered to the platform. 
Other non-functional requirements, such as response speed, and payment cycle are also important.
Well Heard application is intended to meet our end users' needs; in these cases, the patients and therapist.
